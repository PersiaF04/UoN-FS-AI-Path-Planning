Tree model grabbed from here:

Cube and Monkey models I made using Blender defaults and exporting them

How this file works: noise generator will generate a random number 0-99 "x"
It will then go line-by-line on this file and select the first model that
has a weight less than x.  Nothing sophisticated, but it does add some randomness
to the process.  Make sure to always have the last line be weighted at least 100!
(If not it will default to NoiseCube, no biggy, but still...)

If you want to 'inactivate' a model, just set its weight to 0 or put it behind a model
with higher weight.

If gazebo refuses to load, its likely that the meshes don't exist (it halts without error message :/)
